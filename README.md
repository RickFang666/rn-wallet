## How to develop

* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Install expo cli with `npm install -g exp`
* Start the application by `npm start`, then follow the instructions to run it on simulators or devices

## How to publish a test version

* As minification breaks certain libraries, open node_modules/metro/srcJSTransformer/worker/minify.js and change mangle to false. (see [github issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/9711)
* Publish by `exp publish`
